Welcome to the world of audio books! 
In this project, we aim to transform written text into engaging spoken content using Amazon Polly. With the power of artificial intelligence, we can convert any written material, be it a book, article, or newsletter, into high-quality audio narration. 
By leveraging AWS Lambda and Amazon S3, we automate the process of text-to-speech conversion, making it convenient and scalable. 
Join us on this journey as we explore the seamless integration of technology and storytelling, making knowledge accessible to all, one spoken word at a time.
